Core:
  ☐ Ability to add, view, modify and delete availability
    ☐ Go to index, shows form with either "add" or "edit" button depending on whether exists (post or patch to appropriate paths respectively)
  ☐ Show availability and booked slots when booking appointments
  ☐ Delete availability for a given day (set to nil?)
  ☐ Categories display not hooked up at all
  ☐ Availabilities should over-write if duplicate day of the week

Broken things:

Visual:
  ☐ The notices are not nearly obvious enough
  ☐ The error sections are hideous
  ☐ There's too much space between "cards"

Not great things:
  ☐ The availabilities should probably display inside the provider section in the user profile
  ☐ It shows past appointments (make an archive?)
