Core features:

Broken things:

Visual:

Not great things:
  ☐ It shows past appointments (make an archive?)
  ☐ We haven't ensured full functionality when no JS
  ☐ You can change appointment at any time (block if within 24hours?)
  ☐ Before filters don't properly restrict views only for users with client/provider profiles (only done with button hide/show)
  ☐ should have tests

Bonus features:
  ☐ Upload and display images
  ☐ Have geocoder-based toggle to display only "Near me"
  ☐ Ability to show providers by category
  ☐ Nice little calendar for datetime picker
  ☐ Multiple availabilities for the same day (e.g. morning and evening)
  ☐ If a provider books with someone else as a client, that appointment time is not available to clients booking with them (validation and shows in list of existing appointments)
  ☐ Appointments can be shorter than one hour
